# Wingman Coding Challenge  

## Overview  
This project is part of the Wingman Frontend Engineering Coding Challenge. The objective was to create a responsive React application based on the provided Figma design using technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn, while adhering to pixel-perfect design principles.  

## Progress  
I was able to make significant progress on the project, including setting up the React environment, implementing key components, and ensuring responsiveness. However, I couldn't complete all aspects of the challenge as I had multiple commitments today.  

## Features Implemented  
- **Responsive Design:** The layout dynamically adjusts across different screen sizes.  
- **React/Next.js Setup:** The project is scaffolded with Next.js for a seamless developer experience.  
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Used Tailwind CSS and Shadcn for consistent and maintainable styling.  
- **Static Data:** Used fake data to populate the table and UI elements.  

## Pending Tasks  
While the core structure is functional, there are a few tasks that remain unfinished:  
1. **Sorting Functionality:** This was planned for the table but hasnâ€™t been implemented yet.  
2. **Interactive Chat:** Initial work has been done, but the chatbot interaction remains incomplete.  
3. **Pagination:** While partially designed, this feature requires further development.
